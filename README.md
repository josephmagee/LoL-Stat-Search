## Synopsis

LoL Stats is a web application in which you can search for relevant player stats, such as their most played champion and their KDA.

## Motivation

LoL Stats exists as a weekend project that I wanted to utilize the Riot Games API in. It allowed me to create a page using the Handlebars templating engine, nodeJS, and focuses around manipulating information from the API.
